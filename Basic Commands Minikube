kubectl allows us to manage local Kubernetes clusters like the Minikube cluster, 
or remote clusters deployed in the cloud.
It is generally installed before installing and starting Minikube,
but it can also be installed after the cluster bootstrapping step. 
Once installed, kubectl receives its configuration automatically for Minikube Kubernetes cluster access.
However, in different Kubernetes cluster setups, 
we may need to manually configure the cluster access points and certificates required by kubectl to securely access the cluster.

There are different methods that can be used to install kubectl listed in the Kubernetes documentation. 
For best results, it is recommended to keep kubectl at the same version with the Kubernetes run by Minikube.
Next, we will look at a few steps to install it on Linux, macOS, and Windows systems.

Details about the kubectl command line client can be found in the kubectl book, 
the Kubernetes official documentation, or its github repository.
