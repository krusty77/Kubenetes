kubectl allows us to manage local Kubernetes clusters like the Minikube cluster, 
or remote clusters deployed in the cloud.
It is generally installed before installing and starting Minikube,
but it can also be installed after the cluster bootstrapping step. 
Once installed, kubectl receives its configuration automatically for Minikube Kubernetes cluster access.
However, in different Kubernetes cluster setups, 
we may need to manually configure the cluster access points and certificates required by kubectl to securely access the cluster.

There are different methods that can be used to install kubectl listed in the Kubernetes documentation. 
For best results, it is recommended to keep kubectl at the same version with the Kubernetes run by Minikube.
Next, we will look at a few steps to install it on Linux, macOS, and Windows systems.

Details about the kubectl command line client can be found in the kubectl book, 
the Kubernetes official documentation, or its github repository.

To install kubectl on Linux, follow the instruction below:

Download the latest stable kubectl binary, make it executable and move it to the PATH:

$ curl -LO "https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl" && chmod +x kubectl && sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/

Where https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt aims to display the latest Kubernetes stable release version.

NOTE: To download and setup a specific version of kubectl (such as v1.19.1), issue the following command:

$ curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.19.1/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl && chmod +x kubectl && sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/

A typical helpful post-installation configuration is to enable shell autocompletion for kubectl. It can be achieved by running the following four commands: 

$ sudo apt install -y bash-completion

$ source /usr/share/bash-completion/bash-completion

$ source <(kubectl completion bash)

$ echo 'source <(kubectl completion bash)' >>~/.bashrc
